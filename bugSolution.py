def function_with_proper_exception_handling(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
        return result
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        raise e  # Raise the exception to be handled elsewhere

# This version of the function is improved because it raises the 
# ZeroDivisionError, allowing the calling code to handle the exception 
# appropriately.  This is a more robust and predictable approach to 
# error handling.
